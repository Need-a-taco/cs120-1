    return True

'''
    Part C: Implement the 3-coloring algorithm from the sender receiver exercise.
    
    Make sure to call the bfs_2_coloring and is_independent_set functions that you already implemented!

    Hint 1: You will want to use the Python `combinations` function from the itertools library
    to enumerate all possible independent sets. Remember that each element of combinations is a tuple,
    so you may need to convert it to a list.

    Hint 2: Python itertools functions compute their results lazily, which means that they only
    calculate each element as the program requests it. This saves time and space, since it
    doesn't need to store the entire list of combinations up front. You should NOT try to convert the result
    of the entire combinations call to a list, since that will force Python to precompute everything.
    Instead, you should iterate over them in a for loop, which will maintain the lazy behavior we want.
    See the call to "product" in exhaustive_search for an example.

    When you're finished, check your work by running python3 -m ps5_color_tests 3.
    Don't worry if some of your tests time out: that is expected.
